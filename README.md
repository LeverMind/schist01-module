# schist01
A wrist mounted, hand-wired keyboard with touchpad project

Firmware and 3d Files. No build guide available. Feel free to tinker, but this is far from a finished product.
To create this repository, I followed the [ZMK Documentation](https://zmk.dev/docs) for creating a new shield and using the Pointing Devices features for touchpad mouse movement.

See https://adamleblanc.page/portfolio/schist01/ for an overview of the design process
